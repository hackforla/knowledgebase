# How to configure Knowledgebase for Cognito
- Obtain values for these COGNITO_AWS_REGION, COGNITO_USER_POOL_NAME, COGNITO_USER_POOL, COGNITO_CLIENT_ID, and if applicable,COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET from a development lead.  Alternatively, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-how-to-create-a-cognito-user-pool-and-cognito-app-client) to create your own user pool and obtain values for the variables from your own user pool.
- from terminal copy .env.local-example to .env.local or .env.docker-example to .env.docker.  
```
cd django_root
# pick one command from below
cp .env.local-example .env.local
cp .env.docker-example .env.docker
```
- modify .env.local or .env.docker to uncommentout COGNITO variable assignments and modify for values determined.  If COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET has no value, leave it commented out.
# Logging into Knowledgebase configured for Cognito
- Open app with this url: `http://localhost:3000/accounts` . If you get a route does not exist error, then do  `http://localhost:3000/accounts/login`.  
- Press "Continue" on the next screen with title "Sign in Via Amazon Cognito" or similar.
- You will be prompted to sign in (to the user pool).  If you have an account, sign in and skip all the steps below except the last one.
- Click "Sign Up"
- The system will prompt you for username and password.  Amazon will send a verification code to the email you entered.  You can enter a bogus account in which case you will need to follow steps in Managing Users and User Pools to manually verify.
# Logging in locally
- Log into admin: `https://localhost:8001/admin`.
- Look at .env.local or .env.docker for the name of the admin account that is created by default
- Log in as that user
- Create a new user
- Associate the user with other records
- Log out
- Log into admin again: `https://localhost:8001/admin`.  Use the new credentials.  
# Appendix A: How to create a Cognito User Pool and Cognito app client

   - In the Cognito User Pool you just created, go to the **"App Integration"** section.
   - Click **"App clients"** â†’ **"Add an app client"**.

2. **Configure the App Client**

     - Enable `Authorization code grant` and `Implicit grant`.

3. **Save and Deploy**  
   - Click **"Save changes"**.
   - Your Cognito User Pool and App Client are now ready!
# Appendix B: Managing Users, User Pools, and Apps
- Log into the user account you created in Appendix A using https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito.
- Click "User pools" if required
- Click on the user pool you created
- If you click Users, you can modify "Email verified" for a user to simulate entering a verification code
# Appendix C: Gmail Workaround for Creating Multiple User Accounts
See [Logging into Knowledgebase configured for Cognito](#logging-into-knowledgebase-configured-for-cognito).  This includes an option to Sign Up which creates a new account associated with the applicable pool.  If you want to create multiple users and be emailed a verification code, gmail lets you add a period (".") to the username or add +<anything>.  For instance, samsmith@gmail.com, sam.smith@gmail.com, and samsmith+foo@gmail.com will all go to the same gmail account.
